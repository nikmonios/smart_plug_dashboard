# smart_plug_dashboard
Python script to gather data from a Kasa HS110 smart plug and visualise them to Grafana


You should put the script in a cron job in order to run it periodically and gather data.

After that, open your web browser and navigate to the IP of the computer that the script is running, at port 3000.
if it is on the same computer, go to localhost:3000.
